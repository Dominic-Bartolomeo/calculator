Roadmap:

1. Create operation functions (+ - * /)
    - Test - :D

2. Take input and separate into three variables (3 + 5 = 3, +, 5) - :D

3. Use output of #2 to call the correct operation from #1 - :D

4. Create HTML/CSS calcuator (NO JS YET) with 0-9, (+ - * / =) and clear button

5. Store and display the value that is clicked

6. Should only calculate pairs at a time (PEMDAS doesn't matter)
    - Round decimals to x point = :D
    - setup error conditions
    - setup /0 protections - :D


TODO:
- Account for more than one operator.
    - check if more then one, then use result of previous two inputs with next var
