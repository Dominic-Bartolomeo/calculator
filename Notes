Roadmap:

1. Create operation functions (+ - * /)
    - Test - :D

2. Take input and separate into three variables (3 + 5 = 3, +, 5)

3. Use output of #2 to call the correct operation from #1

4. Create HTML/CSS calcuator (NO JS YET) with 0-9, (+ - * / =) and clear button

5. Store and display the value that is clicked

6. Should only calculate pairs at a time (PEMDAS doesn't matter)
    - Round decimals to x point
    - setup error conditions
    - setup /0 protections - :D


TODO:
Fix operate function, parameters are not being taken in correctly.
